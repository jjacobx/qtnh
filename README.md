# Generalised Tensor Network Hub

This project aims to create a generalised distributed software for performing contractions of tensor networks, for the purpose of simulating quantum circuits. 

To build and run the code, execute the following commands: 

```bash
mkdir bin
cd src
make

../bin/gtnh.out
```

Use `make DEBUG=1` to print out more information.
